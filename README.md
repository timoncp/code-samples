# Code Samples

A collection of code samples for a variety of frontend, backend, database and infrastructure purposes.

They are not meant to be used as an npm module, but rather as a repository I use to quickly setup different aspects of a project.

The thought exists, however, to create working npm modules of some (e.g. the high-res pdf export) in the future.
